# Getting Started

import TOCInline from "@theme/TOCInline";

#### Table of contents

<TOCInline toc={toc} />

## Hello World

<p>The smallest MDX example looks like this:</p>

<p>
  It displays a heading saying “Hello, world!” on the page. You could also write
  it like so:
</p>

```md
## Hello, world!
```

This displays the same heading.

```html
<h2>Hello, world!</h2>
```

## Syntax

<p>
  MDX syntax can be boiled down to being JSX in Markdown. It’s a superset of
  Markdown syntax that also supports importing, exporting, and JSX.
</p>

### Markdown

<p>
  Traditionally, Markdown is used to generate HTML. Many developers like writing
  markup in Markdown as it often looks more like what’s intended and it is
  typically terser. Instead of the following HTML:
</p>

```html
<blockquote>
  <p>A blockquote with <em>some</em> emphasis.</p>
</blockquote>
```

You can write the equivalent in Markdown (or MDX) like so:

```md
> A blockquote with _some_ emphasis.
```

<p>
  Markdown is good for <strong>content</strong>. MDX supports standard{" "}
  <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">
    Markdown syntax
  </a>
  . It’s important to understand Markdown in order to learn MDX.
</p>

### JSX

<p>
  Recently, more and more developers have started using{" "}
  <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html">JSX</a> to generate
  HTML markup. JSX is typically combined with a frontend framework like React or
  Vue. These frameworks add support for components, which let you change
  repeating things like the following markup:
</p>

```html
<h2>Hello, Venus!</h2>
<h2>Hello, Mars!</h2>
```

<p>…to JSX (or MDX) like this:</p>

```jsx
<Welcome name="Venus" />
<Welcome name="Mars" />
```

<p>
  JSX is good for <strong>components</strong>. It makes repeating things more
  clear and allows for separation of concerns. MDX fully supports{" "}
  <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html">JSX syntax</a>. Any
  line that start with the <code>&lt;</code> character starts a JSX block.
</p>

### MDX

<p>
  We love HTML, but we’ve created MDX to let you combine the benefits of
  Markdown with the benefits of JSX. The following example shows how they can be
  combined. It’s interactive so go ahead and change the code!
</p>

Below is a JSX block:

```jsx
<div style={{ padding: "10px 30px", backgroundColor: "tomato" }}>
  <h2>Try making this heading have the color green</h2>
</div>
```

<p>
  MDX supports two more features: <a href="#imports">imports</a> and{" "}
  <a href="#exports">exports</a>.
</p>

#### Imports

<p>
  <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/web/javascript/reference/statements/import">
    <code>import</code> (ES2015)
  </a>
  can be used to import components, data, and documents.
</p>

##### Components

<p>
  You can import components, such as your own or from{" "}
  <a href="https://rebassjs.org">rebass</a>, like so:
</p>

```jsx
import { Box, Heading, Text } from 'rebass'

# Here is a JSX block

It is using imported components!

<Box>
  <Heading>Here's a JSX block</Heading>
  <Text>It's pretty neat</Text>
</Box>
```

##### Data

<p>You can also import data that you want to display:</p>

```jsx
import snowfallData from './snowfall.json'
import BarChart from './charts/BarChart'

# Recent snowfall trends

<p>
    2019 has been a particularly snowy year when compared to the last decade.
</p>

<BarChart data={snowfallData} />
```

##### Documents

<p>
  You can embed MDX documents in other documents. This is also known as{" "}
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transclusion">transclusion</a>. You can
  achieve this by importing an <code>.mdx</code> (or <code>.md</code>) file:
</p>

```jsx
import License from './license.md'
import Contributing from './docs/contributing.mdx'

# Hello, world!

<License />

---

<Contributing />
```

##### Exports

<p>
  <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/web/javascript/reference/statements/export">
    <code>export</code> (ES2015)
  </a>{" "}
  can be used to export data and components. For example, you can export
  metadata like which layout to use or the authors of a document. It’s a
  mechanism for an imported MDX file to communicate with the thing that imports
  it.
</p>

<p>Say we import our MDX file, using webpack and React, like so:</p>

```jsx title="index.js"
import React from "react";
import MDXDocument, { metadata } from "posts/post.mdx";

export default () => (
  <>
    <MDXDocument />
    <footer>
      <p>
        By: {metadata.authors.map((author) => author.name).join(", ") + "."}
      </p>
    </footer>
  </>
);
```

<p>
  And our MDX file looks as follows (note the <code>export</code>):
</p>

```jsx title="posts/post.mdx"
import { sue, fred } from '../data/authors'

export const metadata = {
  authors: [sue, fred]
}

# Post about MDX

MDX is a JSX in Markdown loader, parser, and renderer for ambitious projects.
```

After bundling and evaluating, we could get something like this:

```html
<h1>Post about MDX</h1>
<p>
  MDX is a JSX in Markdown loader, parser, and renderer for ambitious projects.
</p>
<footer>
  <p>By: Sue, Fred.</p>
</footer>
```

This is similar to what frontmatter allows in Markdown, but instead of supporting only data in something like YAML, MDX lets you use richer JavaScript structures.

##### Defining variables with exports

If you need to define a variable in your MDX document, you can use an export to do so.
Not only do exports emit data, they instantiate data you can reference in JSX blocks:

```jsx
export const myVariable = "Yay!";

# Hello, world!

<div>{myVariable}</div>
```

## Working with components

In addition to rendering components inline, you can also pass in components to be used instead of the default HTML elements that Markdown compiles to.
This allows you to use your existing components and even CSS-in-JS like <code>styled-components </code>.

The <code>components</code> object is a mapping between the HTML name and the desired component you’d like to render.

```jsx title="src/App.js"
import React from "react";
import Hello from "../hello.mdx";

const MyH1 = (props) => <h1 style={{ color: "tomato" }} {...props} />;
const MyParagraph = (props) => (
  <p style={{ fontSize: "18px", lineHeight: 1.6 }} />
);

const components = {
  h1: MyH1,
  p: MyParagraph,
};

export default () => <Hello components={components} />;
```

You can also import your components from another location like your UI library:

```jsx
import React from "react";
import Hello from "../hello.mdx";

import { Text, Heading, Code, InlineCode } from "../my-ui-library";

export default () => (
  <Hello
    components={{
      h1: Heading,
      p: Text,
      code: Code,
      inlineCode: InlineCode,
    }}
  />
);
```

With the above, the <code>Heading</code> component will be rendered for any <code>h1</code>, <code>Text</code> for <code>p</code> elements, and so on.

In addition to HTML elements, there is one special mapping: <code>inlineCode</code> can be used for code inside paragraphs, tables, etc.

See the [Table of components](/docs/table-of-components) for supported names.
